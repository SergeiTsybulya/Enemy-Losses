# Enemy-Losses

TODO List:
1.  According to the App Review Guideline, more specifically (1.1 Objectionable Content Apps should not include content that is offensive, 
insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy) I suggest renaiming "Personnel Losses" to "Sunwflowers grown".
Where one soldier equals one sunflower. There was a pricident recently when a developer was rejected in their app being published because of the similar naming.
Hence I consider this change required.
2.  Add push notifications when information is updated. The user can turn this on or off or schedule a message for a particular time.
3.  Add the possibility to receive air raid alerts based on the current geolocation (Location Services should be enabled)
4.  Add third screen showing bomb shelters on the map (for those administrative units information about which is available)
